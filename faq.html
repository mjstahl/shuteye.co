						Shuteye is a minimal (no chatting, no document sharing, no whiteboards) video conferencing application that focuses on being browser based and privacy conscious. Shuteye is currently limited to specific set of browsers: <a class="link" href="https://chrome.google.com/">Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a>.

						Recent public profiles of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/">government</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/think-your-skype-messages-get-end-to-end-encryption-think-again/">corporate</a> surveillance has caused me to further evaluate the modern tools we use for communication. The goal of Shuteye was to design a service that offered the maximum amount of privacy without sacrificing a maximum amount of convenience. I feel the best way to protect my users privacy is to be unable to comply with the requests made by law enforcement and other government agencies. Shuteye has no user accounts and all audio and video is encrypted and sent between the participants browsers, circumventing the Shuteye servers.

						It all starts with the <a href="/buy">purchase</a> of Shuteye sessions. You provide your credit card information (not including your name or address), an email, a password, and the number of sessions you wish to purchase. After the transaction completes sucessfully, an email containing a host URL, and an attendee URL is sent to the email you provided. To start a session, open the email, click on the host URL, enter the password you provided (which is NOT in the email), and wait for the other participants to join you using the attendee URL.
